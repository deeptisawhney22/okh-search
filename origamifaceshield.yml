description: Reel-to-reel Laser cutting machine
intended-use: >+
  A higher output option is the use of die-cutting laser machines, which are
  commonly used in the labeling industry to separate adhesive labels from their
  backing sheets. These machines operate in a reel-to-reel fashion, typically
  operating on 13” wide roll film feedstock. The lasing area is typically
  limited to 12”x12” on this equipment, so a 2-3 pull sequential technique must
  be used, requiring advanced setup. With this type of system, on-the-fly
  processing of continuously moving flexible substrates is enabled through the
  use and integration of a reel-to-reel machine, a laser source, and software
  that supports necessary design file types.


  Due to the specialized nature of these machines, layouts and methods will differ, and will need to be optimized by the machine operator. One advantageous capability of the machines is the ability to “kiss cut” the ventilation holes, so that they may be left sealed to increase droplet resistance, or pressed open to allow for longer term comfort and reduced fogging. With these machines, the headbands will need to be processed separately from the main shields in a 2-batch procedure. Roll-takeup optimization of the design can be accomplished either by including a backing sheet, or including tabs that link parts together and are severed as part of a later finishing step.
